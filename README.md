# Features

## <u>Header</u>
The Header consists of the quiz name and has a font-family of Oswald, I chose this font as I thought it was simple and would suit this quiz. The header has a background color of black with white text. The header is also used across all pages of this quiz.

## <u>Index page</u> 
The index page is the home page of this quiz it has an image of the Arsenal F.C. logo in the center of the screen and has text underneath the image for the user to get ready for the quiz. There is also a functional play button that starts the quiz and a highscores button that brings you to the highscores page. I chose the background color for the index page to be firebrick as this is a similar color to Arsenal F.C. club color.

## <u>Footer section</u>
The footer has two icons which will take users to my LinkedIn and my GitHub.

<ul>
<li>A home button that when clicked it will bring you back to the home page.</li>
